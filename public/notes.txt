create react-ap with: 
=> npx create-react-app app-name 

class component require render method 

Add {JavaScript code}

Each React element needs a unique identifier key => to make it easier for React to update a particular element on the DOM 

you can run the file using: 
=> node 

And then: 
=> .load index.js 
you can search for the variable you created, normally you could use your tab and it will be shown as a shadow 

Now, to check if your instance has been created, open another termial for your mongoose and write: 
=> use movieApp
and then: 
=> db.movies.find()
