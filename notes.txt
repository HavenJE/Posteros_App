This has fixed my React not updating problem ðŸ¥³

I suggest doing these three steps:

1. to update npm because it is sometimes buggy.
npm install -g npm@latest 

2. to remove the existing modules.
rm -rf node_modules 

3. to re-install the project dependencies.
npm install 

This should fix the problem.
If it doesn't, please file an issue with a link to your project and versions of Node and npm.

To install React Bootstrap

When doing Navbar with Routes, remember the New Syntax:

1. <Switch> has been replaced by <Routes> 
2. and component with element e.g. 

<Routes>
    <Route path="/home" element={<Home/>} />
</Routes>

For bootstrap 5 spacing important info - check: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/spacing/
